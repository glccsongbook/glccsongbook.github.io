Immortal, Invisible, God Only Wise
4 1
Immortal, invisible, God only wise,
In light inaccessible hid from our eyes,
Most blessed, most glorious, the Ancient of Days,
Almighty, victorious, thy great name we praise.

4 1
Unresting, unhasting, and silent as light,
Nor wanting, nor wasting, thou rulest in might:
Thy justice, like mountains high soaring above,
Thy clouds which are fountains of goodness and love.

4 1
To all, life thou givest, to both great and small;
In all life thou livest, the true life of all;
We blossom and flourish like leaves on the tree,
Then wither and perish, but naught changeth thee.

4 1
Great Father of glory, Pure Father of light,
Thine angels adore thee, all veiling their sight;
All praise we would render; O help us to see,
'Tis only the splendor of light hideth thee!
