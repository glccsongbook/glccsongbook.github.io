Search Me, O Lord (Fanny Crosby, Faye Lopez)

4 1
Search me, O Lord, and try this heart of mine,
Search me, and prove if I indeed am Thine;
Test by Thy Word, that never changed can be,
My strength of hope, and living faith in Thee.

6 2
Search me, O Lord,
Search me, O Lord,
Search me, and know my heart,
Search me today,
Saviour, I pray,
O search me and know my heart.

4 1
Search me, O Lord, subdue each vain desire,
And in my soul a deeper love inspire;
Hide Thou my life, that I, supremely blest,
Beneath Thy wings in perfect peace may rest.

4 1
Search me, O Lord, and from the dross of sin,
Refine as gold, and make me pure within;
Search Thou my thoâ€™ts whose springs Thine eyes can see,
From secret faults, O Saviour, cleanse Thou me.
