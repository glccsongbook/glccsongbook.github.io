The Precious Blood
8 1
Before the cross I kneel 
And see the measure of my sin
How You became a curse for me
Though You were innocent
The magnitude of Your great love 
Was shown in full degree
When righteous blood, The crimson spill
Rained down from Calvary

Oh the precious blood
That flowed from Mercy's side
Washed away my sin when Christ my Savior died
Oh the precious blood of Christ the crucified
It speaks for me before Your throne
Where I stand justified 
8 1
And who am I that I should know
This treasure of such worth
My Savior's pure atoning blood
Shed for the wrath I'd earned
For sin has stained my every deed
My every word and thought
What wondrous love that makes me one
Your priceless blood has bought

Bridge:
A crown of thorns, Pierced hands and feet
A body bruised, And Mercy's plea
