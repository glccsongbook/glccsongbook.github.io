Trust and Obey
6 1
When we walk with the Lord
In the light of His Word
What a glory He sheds on our way
While we do His good will
He abides with us still
And with all who will trust and obey
4 2
Trust and obey
For there’s no other way
To be happy in Jesus
But to trust and obey
6 1
Not a shadow can rise
Not a cloud in the skies
But His smile quickly drives it away
Not a doubt nor a fear
Nor a sigh nor a tear
Can abide while we trust and obey
6 1
Not a burden we bear
Not a sorrow we share
But our toil He doth richly repay
Not a grief or a loss
Not a frown or a cross
But is blessed if we trust and obey
6 1
But we never can prove
The delights of His love
Until all on the altar we lay
For the favor He shows
And the joy He bestows
Are for them who will trust and obey
6 1
Then in fellowship sweet
We will sit at His feet
Or we’ll walk by His side in the way
What He says we will do
Where He sends we will go
Never fear, only trust and obey
