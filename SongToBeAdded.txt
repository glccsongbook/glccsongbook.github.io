The River
4 1
To the river I am going
Bringing sins I cannot bear
Come and cleanse me, come forgive me
Lord I need to meet you there
4 2
Precious Jesus, I am ready
To surrender every care
Take my hand now, lead me closer
Lord I need to meet you there
4 1
In these waters, healing mercy
Flows with freedom from despair
I am going, to that river
Lord I need to meet you there
4 1
Come and join us, in the river
Come find life beyond compare
He is calling, He is waiting
Jesus longs to meet you there
