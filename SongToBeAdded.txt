Lord I Need You (Matt Maher)
4 1
Lord, I come, I confess
Bowing here I find my rest
Without You I fall apart
You're the One that guides my heart
4 2
Lord, I need You, oh, I need You
Every hour I need You
My one defense, my righteousness
Oh God, how I need You
4 1
Where sin runs deep Your grace is more
Where grace is found is where You are
And where You are, Lord, I am free
Holiness is Christ in me
5 1
Bridge:
Teach my song to rise to You
When temptation comes my way
And when I cannot stand I'll fall on You
Jesus, You're my hope and stay
