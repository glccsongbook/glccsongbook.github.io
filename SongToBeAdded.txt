Come, Thou Fount of Ev'ry Blessing

8 1
Come, thou Fount of ev'ry blessing;
tune my heart to sing thy grace;
streams of mercy, never ceasing,
call for songs of loudest praise.
Teach me some melodious sonnet,
sung by flaming tongues above;
praise the mount! I’m fixed upon it,
mount of God’s unchanging love!
8 1
Here I raise my Ebenezer;
hither by thy help I’m come;
and I hope, by thy good pleasure,
safely to arrive at home.
Jesus sought me when a stranger,
wandr'ing from the fold of God;
he, to rescue me from danger,
interposed his precious blood.
8 1
O to grace how great a debtor
daily I’m constrained to be!
Let that grace now, like a fetter,
bind my wandr'ing heart to thee.
Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it,
prone to leave the God I love;
here’s my heart; O take and seal it;
seal it for thy courts above.
