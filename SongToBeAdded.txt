Here I Am, Lord

4 1
I, the Lord of sea and sky
I have heard my people cry
All who dwell in dark and sin
My hand will save

4 2
Here I am, Lord. Is it I, Lord?
I have heard you calling in the night
I will go, Lord, if you lead me
I will hold your people in my heart

4 1
I, who made the stars of night
I will make their darkness bright
Who will bear my light to them?
Whom shall I send?

4 1
I, the Lord of snow and rain
I have borne my people's pain
I have wept for love of them
They turn away

4 1
I will break their hearts of stone
Give them hearts for love alone
I will speak my words to them
Whom shall I send?

4 1
I, the Lord of wind and flame,
I will send the poor and lame.
I will set a feast for them.
My hand will save.

4 1
Finest bread I will provide,
'Til their hearts be satisfied.
I will give my life to them.
Whom shall I send?
