God Sees the Heart
8 1
Our God measures man
By a standard divine
For He sees underneath
Ev'ry outward design
He looks past possessions
And costly attire
He studies the heart--
Ev'ry thought and desire

8 2
For the eyes of the Lord
Are searching to and fro
We have no secrets
That our God does not know
Our Father knows our thoughts
He understands ev'ry part
Man sees the outside
But God sees the heart

8 1
Our God does not judge
By how tall we may stand
Or how much we possess
Or the rank we command
His gaze goes far deeper
To things that endure
He honors the man
Who keeps his heart pure
