I Love to Tell The Story
4 1
I love to tell the story of unseen things above
Of Jesus and His glory of Jesus and his love
I love to tell the story because I know 'tis true
It satisfies my longings as nothing else can do

I love to tell the story, 'twill be my theme in glory            
To tell the old old story, of Jesus and his love

I love to tell the story 'tis pleasant to repeat
What seems each time I tell it  more wonderfully sweet    
I love to tell the story  for some have never heard
The message of salvation from God's own holy word 
4 1
I love to tell the story, for those who know it best
Seem hungering and thirsting to hear it like the rest.
And when  in scenes of glory  I sing the new, new song
Twill be the old old story that I have loved so long
