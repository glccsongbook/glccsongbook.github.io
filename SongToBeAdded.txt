It Is Finished

4 1
Long ago I saw my Saviour
Bearing shame upon a tree;
Then my heart was touched with sorrow,
For I saw He bled for me.

4 2
"It is finished," loud He cried;
O what love— for me He died.
In my stead He bled on Calvary;
Once for all Christ rescued me.

4 1
Lo, the sky was veiled in darkness;
Sudden trembling shook the ground
As the angry crowd was jeering,
Mocking Jesus all around.

4 1
Then my Saviour called to heaven
As I saw His love anew,
"O my Father, please forgive them,
For they know not what they do."

4 1
Free salvation now he offers;
Take His gift, O hear His plea;
On the bloody cross behold Him,
Join His shout of victory.
