Lord Bless Our Home

5 1
Families all around us are crumbing every day,
Yielding to the enemy and throwing life away.
Bind our lives together, Guard us with Your truth;
When the struggle seems too great,
Lord, keep our eyes on You.

7 2
Lord, bless our home, protect our home;
Let it be a refuge in this world of sin.
Lord, reign within,
keep us strong and true;
And when we need You most,
Lord, draw us close, committed to each other.
Lord, bless our home; we give our home to You.

8 1
Thank You for Your goodness;
our love was in Your plan.
Help us face the future always
trusting in Your hand.
Keep us warm and tender;
Keep us clean and pure.
Drive us to each other's arms,
and make our love endure.
