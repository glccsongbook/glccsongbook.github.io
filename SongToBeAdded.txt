My Very Best Friend

5 1
Jesus is exalted; Every knee shall bow to honor Him.
Praise the Prince of Heaven; Join the angels and the seraphim.
Though He rules creation, Even though He reigns above,
From His throne on high Jesus came to die;
Taste His wondrous love.

9 2
Jesus sticks closer than a brother;
Every moment He is near.
I know He never will forsake me;
He has conquered all my fear.
Jesus sticks closer than a brother;
On His love I can depend.
King of Kings, Lord of Lords,
Conquering Son--
Though all of these, He's my very best Friend.

Glory to the Savior, All my praise shall be to Christ alone:
He is my foundation, He's my rock, and He's my cornerstone.
Like a mighty fortress, He is evermore the same;
Yet He died for me on Mount Calvary:
Now I bear His name.
