Pass Me Not, O Gentle Saviour

4 1
Pass me not, O gentle Savior
Hear my humble cry
While on others Thou art calling
Do not pass me by

4 2
Savior, Savior
Hear my humble cry
While on others Thou art calling
Do not pass me by

4 1
Let me at Thy throne of mercy
Find a sweet relief
Kneeling there in deep contrition
Help my unbelief

4 1
Trusting only in Thy merit
Would I seek Thy face
Heal my wounded, broken spirit
Save me by Thy grace

4 1
Thou the spring of all my comfort
More than life to me
Whom have I on earth beside Thee?
Whom in Heav'n but Thee?
