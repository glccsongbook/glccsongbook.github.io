The Wonder Of It All
4 1
There's the wonder of sunset at evening
The wonder as sunrise I see
But the wonder of wonders that thrills my soul
Is the wonder that God loves me

4 2
O the wonder of it all the wonder of it all
Just to think that God loves me
O the wonder of it all the wonder of it all
Just to think that God loves me

4 1
There's the wonder of springtime and harvest
The sky the stars the sun
But the wonder of wonders that thrills my soul
Is a wonder that's only begun

4 1
There's the wonder of God's revelation
The Word Who dwelt amongst men;
But the wonder of wonders that thrills my soul
Is that Jesus is coming again.
