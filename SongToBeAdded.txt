Higher Ground

4 1
I’m pressing on the upward way,
New heights I’m gaining every day;
Still praying as I’m upward bound,
“Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.”

4 2
Lord, lift me up and let me stand,
By faith, on Heaven’s table land,
A higher plane than I have found;
Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.

4 1
My heart has no desire to stay
Where doubts arise and fears dismay;
Though some may dwell where those abound,
My prayer, my aim, is higher ground.

4 1
I want to scale the utmost height
And catch a gleam of glory bright;
But still I’ll pray till Heav’n I’ve found,
“Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.”

4 1
Beyond the mist I fain would rise,
To rest beneath unclouded skies,
Above earth’s turmoil peace is found
By those who dwell on higher ground.

4 1
I want to live above the world,
Though satan’s darts at me are hurled;
For faith has caught the joyful sound,
The song of saints on higher ground.

4 1
Lord lead me up the mountain side,
I dare not climb without my Guide;
And, heaven gained, I’ll gaze around,
with grateful heart from higher ground.
