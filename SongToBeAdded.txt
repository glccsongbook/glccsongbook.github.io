O Come, All You Unfaithful

6 1
O come, all you unfaithful
Come, weak and unstable
Come, know you are not alone
O come, barren and waiting ones
Weary of praying, come
See what your God has done

2 2
Christ is born, Christ is born
Christ is born for you

O come, bitter and broken
Come with fears unspoken
Come, taste of His perfect love
O come, guilty and hiding ones
There is no need to run
See what your God has done

2 2
Christ is born, Christ is born
Christ is born for you

8 1
He's the Lamb who was given
Slain for our pardon
His promise is peace
For those who believe
He's the Lamb who was given
Slain for our pardon
His promise is peace
For those who believe

3 1
So come, though you have nothing
Come, He is the offering
Come, see what your God has done

4 2
Christ is born, Christ is born
Christ is born for you
Christ is born, Christ is born
Christ is born for you
