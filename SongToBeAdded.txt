Worthy Is The Lamb (Ron Hamilton)

4 1
Weep not! Weep not! Weep no more.
For One is found worthy, Jesus Christ the Lord.
The Lion of Judah, The Savior, the great I Am,
Weep not! O weep not! Behold the Lamb.

7 2
Worthy is the Lamb!  Worthy is the Lamb!
Worthy is the Lamb that was slain!
Worthy is the Lamb!
Worthy to receive power and riches, 
Worthy to receive wisdom and strength,
Worthy of honour and glory, and blessing:
Worthy is the Lamb! Worthy is the Lamb!

Fear not! Fear not! Fear no more.
For One is found worthy, Jesus Christ the Lord.
So join all creation, And echo the heavenly song.
Sing with the angels, One hundred million strong.
