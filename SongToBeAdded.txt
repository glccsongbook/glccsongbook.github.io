Goodness of God
6 1
I love you, Lord
For your mercy never fails me
All my days, I’ve been held in your hands
From the moment that I wake up
Until I lay my head
I will sing of the goodness of God

All my life you have been faithful
All my life you have been so, so good
With every breath that I am able
I will sing of the goodness of God

I love your voice
You have led me through the fire
In darkest night you are close like no other
I’ve known you as a father
I’ve known you as a friend
I have lived in the goodness of God

4 2
All my life you have been faithful
All my life you have been so, so good
With every breath that I am able
I will sing of the goodness of God

(Bridge)
Your goodness is running after,
It’s running after me
Your goodness is running after,
It’s running after me
With my life laid down, I’m surrendered now
I give you everything
Your goodness is running after,
It’s running after me
Your goodness is running after,
It’s running after me
Your goodness is running after,
It’s running after me
With my life laid down, I’m surrendered now
I give you everything
Your goodness is running after,
It’s running after me

5 2
All my life you have been faithful
All my life you have been so, so good
With every breath that I am able
I will sing of the goodness of God
Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God
