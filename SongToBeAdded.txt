Because He Lives
4 1
God sent His son, they called him Jesus
He came to love, heal and forgive
He lived and died to buy my pardon
An empty tomb is there to prove my Saviour lives
4 2
Because He lives, I can face tomorrow
Because He lives, all fear is gone
Because I know He holds the future
And life is worth the living just because He lives
4 1
How sweet to hold a newborn baby,
And feel the pride and joy he gives
But greater still the calm assurance
This child can face uncertain days because He Lives
4 1
The Son of God, He paid my ransom
Went to the cross, my sins to bear
No greater love His life He laid down
He died for me and thus forever set me free
4 1
Now I serve Him, my Living Saviour
I walk with Him, from day to day
He leads me on the heavenly pathway
I know He keeps me in the shadow of His wings
4 1
And then one day, I'll cross the river
I'll fight lifes final war with pain
And then as death gives way to victory
I'll see the lights of glory and I'll know He lives
