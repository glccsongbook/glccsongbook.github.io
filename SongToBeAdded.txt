Once Again

5 1
Jesus Christ, I think upon Your sacrifice
You became nothing, poured out to death
Many times I've wondered at Your gift of life
And I'm in that place once again
I'm in that place once again

4 2
And once again I look upon the cross where You died
I'm humbled by Your mercy and I'm broken inside
Once again I thank You
Once again I pour out my life

6 1
Now You are exalted to the highest place
King of the heavens
Where one day I'll bow
But for now I marvel at this saving grace
And I'm full of praise once again
I'm full of praise once again

4 2
And once again I look upon the cross where You died
I'm humbled by Your mercy and I'm broken inside
Once again I thank You
Once again I pour out my life

Bridge (x2):
Thank You for the cross
Thank You for the cross
Thank You for the cross, my Friend

4 2
And once again I look upon the cross where You died
I'm humbled by Your mercy and I'm broken inside
Once again I thank You
Once again I pour out my life
