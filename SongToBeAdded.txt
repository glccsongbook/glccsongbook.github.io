We are children, children of the light,
We are shining in the darkness of the night,
Pray for this world,
Joy through all the land,
Touch the heart of everyone
Take everybody's hand.

Share the light in his name,
We are children of the light.

Spread good news to everyone,
There's still plenty of time for we have just begun.

And a promise of rebirth.

Of the love there in your heart.
