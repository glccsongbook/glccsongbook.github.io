Listen For The Trumpet

4 1
Shadows are falling, Time marches on;
Prophets are echoing:  Soon Christ will come,
Looking into the heart of man, Seeking His own,
Calling all of the faithful: “Children, come home.”

6 2
Listen for the trumpet, Jesus is coming.
Listen for the trumpet, Look to the sky.
No more sorrow, no more night,
Only God’s eternal light;
Jesus is coming again.  Jesus is coming again.
Jesus is coming.  Listen for the trumpet.

4 1
Come, Lord, in majesty From heaven’s throne;
Shout for Your saints to rise, Lord, take us home;
Call us out of this world of sin; Come Lord, today.
Quickly, Jesus, come quickly, Take us away.
