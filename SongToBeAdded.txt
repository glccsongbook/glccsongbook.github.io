Meekness and Majesty

8 1
Meekness and majesty,
Manhood and Deity,
In perfect harmony,
The Man who is God.
Lord of eternity
Dwells in humanity,
Kneels in humility
And washes our feet.

5 2
O what a mystery,
Meekness and majesty.
Bow down and worship
For this is your God,
This is your God.

8 1
Father’s pure radiance,
Perfect in innocence,
Yet learns obedience
To death on a cross.
Suffering to give us life,
Conq’ring through sacrifice,
And as they crucify
Prays: ‘Father forgive.’

8 1
Wisdom unsearchable,
God the invisible,
Love indestructible
In frailty appears.
Lord of infinity,
Stooping so tenderly,
Lifts our humanity
To the heights of His throne.
