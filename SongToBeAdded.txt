Your Lord and King adore!
Rejoice, give thanks and sing,
And triumph evermore.

Lift up your heart,
Lift up your voice!

Jesus, the Savior, reigns,
The God of truth and love;
When He has purged our stains,
He took his seat above;

Lift up your heart,
Lift up your voice!
Rejoice, again I say, rejoice!

He sits at God's right hand,
Till all His foes submit;
And bow to his command,
And fall beneath His feed;

3 2
Lift up your heart,
Lift up your voice!
Rejoice, again I say, rejoice!

Rejoice in glorious hope!
Our Lord and judge shall come
And take His servants up
To their eternal home;

Lift up your heart,
Lift up your voice!
Rejoice, again I say, rejoice!
