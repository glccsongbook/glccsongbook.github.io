I'm In The Lord's Army
5 1
I may never march in the infantry, Ride in the cavalry, Shoot the artillery.
I may never fly o’er the enemy, But I’m in the Lord’s ar-my. (yes, sir!)
I’m in the Lord’s ar-my, (yes, sir!) I’m in the Lord’s ar-my, (yes, sir!)
I may never march in the infantry, Ride in the Calvary, Shoot the artillery.
I may never fly o’er the enemy, But I’m in the Lord’s ar-my. (yes, sir!)
