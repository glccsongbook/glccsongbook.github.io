Go Tell It On The Mountain
2 2
Go tell it on the mountain, over the hills and everywhere;
Go tell it on the mountain that Jesus Christ is born.
2 1
While shepherds kept their watching o'er silent flocks by night,
Behold throughout the heavens there shone a Holy Light.
2 1
The shepherds feared and trembled when lo! Above the earth,
Rang out the angel chorus that hailed our Saviour's birth.
2 1
Down in a lowly manger the humble Christ was born
And brought us God's salvation that blessed Christmas morn!
