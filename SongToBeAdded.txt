Thine Be The Glory
4 2
Thine be the glory
Risen conquering Son
Endless is the victory
Thou o'er death hast won

4 1
Angels in bright raiment
Rolled the stone away
Kept the folded grave clothes
Where Thy body lay

4 2
Thine be the glory
Risen conquering Son
Endless is the victory
Thou o'er death hast won

4 1
Lo! Jesus meets us
Risen from the tomb
Lovingly, He greets us
Scatters fear and gloom

4 1
Let the church with gladness
Hymns of triumph sing
For her Lord now liveth
Death hath lost its sting

4 2
Thine be the glory
Risen conquering Son
Endless is the victory
Thou o'er death hast won

4 1
No more we doubt Thee
Glorious Prince of life
Life is naught without Thee
Aid us in our strife

4 1
Make us more than conquerors
Through Thy deathless love
Bring us safe through Jordan
To Thy home above

4 2
Thine is the glory
Risen conquering Son
Endless is the victory
Thou o'er death hast won
