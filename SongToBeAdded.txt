See What A Morning
4 1
See, what a morning, gloriously bright
With the dawning of hope in Jerusalem
Folded the grave-clothes, tomb filled with light
As the angels announce, "Christ is risen!"

4 1
See God's salvation plan
Wrought in love, borne in pain, paid in sacrifice
Fulfilled in Christ, the Man
For He lives, Christ is risen from the dead!

4 1
See Mary weeping, "Where is He laid?"
As in sorrow, she turns from the empty tomb
Hears a voice speaking, calling her name
It's the Master, the Lord raised to life again!

4 1
The voice that spans the years
Speaking life, stirring hope, bringing peace to us
Will sound 'til He appears
For He lives, Christ is risen from the dead!

4 1
One with the Father, Ancient of Days
Through the Spirit who clothes faith with certainty
Honor and blessing, glory and praise
To the King crowned with pow'r and authority!

4 1
And we are raised with Him
Death is dead, love has won, Christ has conquered
And we shall reign with Him
For He lives, Christ is risen from the dead!

4 1
And we are raised with Him
Death is dead, love has won, Christ has conquered
And we shall reign with Him
For He lives, Christ is risen from the dead!
