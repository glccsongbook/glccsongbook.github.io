I Offer My Life
4 1
All that I am, all that I have
I lay them down before You, o Lord
All my regrets, all my acclaim
the joy and the pain I'm making them Yours
6 2
Lord, I offer my life to You      
Everything I've been through
Use it for Your glory
Lord, I offer my days to You
Lifting my praise to You as a pleasing sacrifice
Lord, I offer You my life.
4 1
Things in the past, things yet unseen
Wishes and dreams that are yet to come true
All of my hopes, all of my plans
My heart and my hand are lifted to You
