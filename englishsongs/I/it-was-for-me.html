            <p>The King and Lord of all?</p>
            <p>Why heal a lonely beggar?</p>
            <p>Why cause the blind to see?</p>

            <p>Why suffer such betrayal,</p>

            <p>The spotless Lamb of Heaven</p>
            <p>Given there for me.</p>

            <p>The King Who came from Heaven,</p>
            <p>To the cry, "There is no room,"</p>
            <p>Now must lay His weary body</p>
            <p>In a cold and borrowed tomb.</p>
            <p>But the grave it could not hold Him;</p>
            <p>Death lost its victory.</p>
            <p>The risen Lord of glory is living now for me!</p>
