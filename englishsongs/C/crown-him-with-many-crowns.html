          </div>

          <div class="bs-component">
            <p>Crown Him with many crowns, the Lamb upon His throne.</p>
            <p>Hark! How the heavenly anthem drowns all music but its own.</p>
            <p>Awake, my soul, and sing of Him who died for thee,</p>
            <p>And hail Him as thy matchless King through all eternity.</p>
            <br></br>

            <p>Crown Him the virgin’s Son, the God incarnate born,</p>
            <p>Whose arm those crimson trophies won which now His brow adorn;</p>
            <p>Fruit of the mystic rose, as of that rose the stem;</p>
            <p>The root whence mercy ever flows, the Babe of Bethlehem.</p>
            <br></br>

            <p>Crown Him the Son of God, before the worlds began,</p>
            <p>And ye who tread where He hath trod, crown Him the Son of Man;</p>
            <p>Who every grief hath known that wrings the human breast,</p>
            <p>And takes and bears them for His own, that all in Him may rest.</p>
            <br></br>

            <p>Crown Him the Lord of life, who triumphed over the grave,</p>
            <p>And rose victorious in the strife for those He came to save.</p>
            <p>His glories now we sing, who died, and rose on high,</p>
            <p>Who died eternal life to bring, and lives that death may die.</p>
            <br></br>

            <p>Crown Him the Lord of peace, whose power a scepter sways</p>
            <p>From pole to pole, that wars may cease, and all be prayer and praise.</p>
            <p>His reign shall know no end, and round His piercèd feet</p>
            <p>Fair flowers of paradise extend their fragrance ever sweet.</p>
            <br></br>

            <p>Crown Him the Lord of love, behold His hands and side,</p>
            <p>Those wounds, yet visible above, in beauty glorified.</p>
            <p>No angel in the sky can fully bear that sight,</p>
            <p>But downward bends his burning eye at mysteries so bright.</p>
            <br></br>

            <p>Crown Him the Lord of Heaven, enthroned in worlds above,</p>
            <p>Crown Him the King to Whom is given the wondrous name of Love.</p>
            <p>Crown Him with many crowns, as thrones before Him fall;</p>
            <p>Crown Him, ye kings, with many crowns, for He is King of all.</p>
            <br></br>

            <p>Crown Him the Lord of lords, who over all doth reign,</p>
            <p>Who once on earth, the incarnate Word, for ransomed sinners slain,</p>
            <p>Now lives in realms of light, where saints with angels sing</p>
            <p>Their songs before Him day and night, their God, Redeemer, King.</p>
            <br></br>

            <p>Crown Him the Lord of years, the Potentate of time,</p>
            <p>Creator of the rolling spheres, ineffably sublime.</p>
            <p>All hail, Redeemer, hail! For Thou has died for me;</p>
            <p>Thy praise and glory shall not fail throughout eternity.</p>
