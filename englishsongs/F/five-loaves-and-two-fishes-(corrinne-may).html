            <h2>Five Loaves and Two Fishes</h2>
          </div>

          <div class="bs-component">
            <p>A little boy of thirteen was on his way to school</p>
            <p>He heard a crowd of people laughing and he went to take a look</p>
            <p>Thousands were listening to the stories of one man</p>
            <p>He spoke with such wisdom, even the kids could understand</p>
            <br></br>

            <p>The hours passed so quickly, the day turned into night</p>
            <p>Everyone was hungry but there was no food in sight</p>
            <p>The boy looked in his lunchbox at the little that he had</p>
            <p>He wasn't sure what good it'd do, there were thousands to be fed</p>
            <br></br>

            <p>But he saw the twinkling eyes of Jesus</p>
            <p>The kindness in His smile</p>
            <p>And the boy cried out</p>
            <p>With the trust of a child</p>
            <p>He said:</p>
            <br></br>

            <p>"Take my five loaves and two fishes</p>
            <p>Do with it as you will</p>
            <p>I surrender</p>
            <p>Take my fears and my inhibitions</p>
            <p>All my burdens, my ambitions</p>
            <p>You can use it all to feed them all"</p>
            <br></br>

            <p>I often think about that boy when I'm feeling small</p>
            <p>And I worry that the work I do means nothing at all</p>
            <br></br>

            <p>But every single tear I cry is a diamond in His hands</p>
            <p>And every door that slams in my face, I will offer up in prayer</p>
            <br></br>

            <p>So I'll give you every breath that I have</p>
            <p>Oh Lord, you can work miracles</p>
            <p>All that you need is my "Amen"</p>
            <br></br>

            <p>So take my five loaves and two fishes</p>
            <p>Do with it as you will</p>
            <p>I surrender</p>
            <p>Take my fears and my inhibitions</p>
            <p>All my burdens, my ambitions</p>
            <p>You can use it all</p>
            <p>I hope it's not too small</p>
            <br></br>

            <p>I trust in you</p>
            <p>I trust in you</p>
            <br></br>

            <p>So take my five loaves and two fishes</p>
            <p>Do with it as you will</p>
            <p>I surrender</p>
            <p>Take my fears and my inhibitions</p>
            <p>All my burdens, my ambitions</p>
            <p>You can use it all</p>
            <p>No gift is too small</p>
            <br></br>
