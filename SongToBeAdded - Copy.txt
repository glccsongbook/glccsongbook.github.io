Come Behold The Wondrous Mystery
4 1
Come behold the wondrous mystery
in the dawning of the King.
He the theme of heaven’s praises
robed in frail humanity.
4 1
In our longing, in our darkness
now the light of life has come.
Look to Christ, who condescended
took on flesh to ransom us
4 1
Come behold the wondrous mystery
He the perfect Son of Man.
In His living, in His suffering
never trace nor stain of sin.
4 1
See the true and better Adam
come to save the hell-bound man.
Christ the great and sure fulfillment
of the law; in Him we stand.
4 1
Come behold the wondrous mystery
Christ the Lord upon the tree.
In the stead of ruined sinners
hangs the Lamb in victory.
4 1
See the price of our redemption;
see the Father’s plan unfold.
Bringing many sons to glory
grace unmeasured, love untold.
4 1
Come behold the wondrous mystery;
slain by death the God of life.
But no grave could e’er restrain Him;
praise the Lord; He is alive!
4 1
What a foretaste of deliverance;
how unwavering our hope.
Christ in power resurrected
as we will be when he comes.
